      <p class="intro-text"><strong>Pickles (born 1962 or 1963; died 1967) was known for his role in finding the stolen Jules Rimet Trophy in March 1966, four months before the 1966 FIFA World Cup was scheduled to kick off in England.</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-info">
        <li>The World Cup trophy was stolen on the afternoon of Sunday 20 March 1966.</li>
        <li>A telephone call from a man who called himself "Jackson" to Joe Mears, chairman of Chelsea F.C. and The Football Association, alerted him that a package would be left at Stamford Bridge the following day: it contained a £15,000 ransom
          demand, accompanied by the removable lining from the top of the trophy.</li>
        <li>The rest of the trophy was found on Sunday 27 March, just seven days after it was stolen, wrapped in newspaper lying by the front wheel of a neighbour's car in Beulah Hill, Upper Norwood, South London, by the four-year-old Pic
        <li>When England won the trophy, Pickles was invited to the celebration banquet as a reward.</li>
        <li>Corbett collected nearly £5,000 as a reward.[6][7] He used the money to buy a house in Lingfield, Surrey, in 1967. Pickles was awarded the silver medal of the National Canine Defence League.</li>
